    <h2>Kiwi Heritage</h2>
    <h3>New Zealand has long been acknowledged as one of the world’s most gloriously pure countries and as the leading source of high quality natural resources. At the heart of Key-Ora’s products are these Kiwi resources, which we prioritize as being the key ingredient for all of our products. These national resources are then blended with various internationally sourced resources, creating a beautiful synergy. Our products are formulated and created in New Zealand, to ensure that our Kiwi heritage shines through during the entire process, from R&D, all the way through to production.</h4>

    <h2>Purity</h2>
    <h3>Key-Ora is a firm believer in the fact that the end-result delivered by dietary supplementary products is predominantly determined by the purity and effectiveness of the ingredients contained within them. In developing our products, Key-Ora is focused on identifying and procuring only the purest sources of ingredients. When these pure ingredients are blended together in the production of Key-Ora’s products, they provide fantastic health benefits to our consumers.</h4>
