          <p>Supplements are easy to add to the daily diet, and this is often the first step that people take toward greater nutritional awareness and the adoption of other healthy lifestyle choices. Whether taking a multivitamin, herb or speciality product, people can and do live healthier lives by supplementing their diets. By also taking supplements, it can help supply the nutrients that are lacking in our body.</p>

          <p>Let your healthcare providers (including doctors, pharmacists, and dietitians) know which dietary supplements you’re taking so that you can discuss what’s best for your overall health. Your healthcare provider can help you determine which supplements, if any, might be valuable for you. Keep a record of the supplements you take in one place, just as you should be doing for all of your medicines. Note the specific product name, the dose you take, how often you take it, and the reason why you use each one. <br />
          It's especially important to ask your doctor about taking a supplement if you're pregnant or nursing, about to have surgery, or you have a health condition such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes. Also, use caution if giving a supplement to a child.</p>
