              <h3>Asthma</h3>
              <p>Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways that periodically causes difficulty in breathing. Asthma is very common in Australia and New Zealand and is becoming more prevalent. Children are particularly susceptible to asthma.</p>

              <h3>Candida</h3>
              <p>Candida albicans is a strain of yeast that naturally inhabits the mucous membranes of the digestive tract, respiratory tract and vagina, where it exists in a delicate balance with a number of other organisms. If that balance is disturbed,
                an overgrowth of candida may occur, resulting in thrush and a wide range of other symptoms.</p>

              <h3>Excema & Dermatitis</h3>
              <p>Dermatitis is an itchy, inflammatory skin problem that can have numerous different causes. The condition commonly called eczema is an allergic form of dermatitis, and is known medically as atopic dermatitis.</p>

              <h3>Sinusitis</h3>
              <p>The sinuses are airspaces within the bones of the face (cheeks, forehead and around the eyes). The term sinusitis is used to refer to inflammation in these areas, which is most commonly caused by allergy or infection.</p>

              <h3>Psoriasis</h3>
              <p>Psoriasis is characterised by the accumulation of scaly pink-red or silvery-white patches on the skin, which may or may not be itchy.</p>

              <h3>Circulatory Problems</h3>
              <p>Circulatory problems can take many forms, and can range from a minor inconvenience (such as cold hands and feet) to cosmetic problems like burst blood vessels, and painful, aching conditions like VARICOSE VEINS. Other situations may be indicative
                of underlying disease processes (e.g. leg ulcers, Raynaud&#39;s disease, intermittent claudication and peripheral arterial disease).</p>

              <h3>Gout</h3>
              <p>Gout is a type of arthritis associated with raised blood levels of uric acid. Deposits of uric acid crystals form in the joints, tendons, kidneys and other tissues, causing inflammation and damage.</p>

              <h3>Headache &amp; Migraine</h3>
              <p>Headaches affect most of us from time to time, for a variety of reasons. Migraines are a specific form of headache that tend to be severe, and may be associated with Nausea and vomiting, as well as other symptoms.</p>

              <h3>Muscle Cramps</h3>
              <p>Cramps occur when a muscle contracts painfully and involuntarily.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <h3>Osteoarthritis</h3>
              <p>Osteoarthritis is a progressive disorder of the joints and cartilage that becomes more common with age, although it may also affect young people. Joints that are commonly affected include the knees, hips, spine and hands. Osteoarthritis
                causes pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints, and may reduce mobility.</p>

              <h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3>
              <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory progressive disease that affects the joints, especially the hands, wrists, feet and knees. The inflammation makes the joints stiff, swollen, painful and sometimes misshapen. Rheumatoid arthritis is
                a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue in the joints and it can potentially lead to irreversible joint destruction and disability.</p>

              <h3>Seniors Health</h3>
              <p>As we get older, we become increasingly susceptible to health problems. Many of the conditions that we commonly associate with ageing can be relieved or prevented through a healthy diet and lifestyle.</p>

              <h3>ADHD</h3>
              <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural and developmental disorder that affects 2-5% of children, and may also persist into adulthood. Children with ADHD tend to have short attention spans, making it difficult for
                them to concentrate and to learn skills such as reading and writing. They may also have difficulty forming relationships.</p>

              <h3>Colds & Flu</h3>
              <p>Colds can be caused by any of a large number of viral infections, and normally last 7-10 days. On the other hand, flu is caused by one of the Influenza group of viruses, and tends to last longer than a cold.</p>

              <h3>Nausea & Vomitting</h3>
              <p>Feeling nauseous or sick in the stomach is a warning that vomiting may be imminent. In many cases, the queasy feeling occurs alone, and vomiting does not eventuate; it is relatively rare for vomiting to occur without an accompanying feeling
                of nausea.</p>
